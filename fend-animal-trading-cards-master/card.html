			<p>Eurasian lynx are medium sized felids that come in a variety of colours and patterns according to their locality. As you move further south throughout the lynx's range they tend to be more red/brown in colour and more heavily spotted. Coat colour can also vary with the season, red/brown being more common in warm months and grey/silver in winter months.</p>
